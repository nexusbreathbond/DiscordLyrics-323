DiscordLyrics syncs Spotify lyrics from currently playing song to your custom status. By doing this it is a breach of discord tos for self botting so please use responsibly.

## Highlights

- Live lyric status from Spotify playback.
- LRCLIB synced lyric lookup.
- Pause fallback using the last detected track.
- Rate-conscious status updates.

## Client Support

| Client | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| BetterDiscord | Supported | Uses the packaged `.plugin.js` release file. |
| Vencord | Supported | Installs as a source userplugin and rebuilds the client. |
| Equicord | Supported | Uses the same source userplugin layout as Vencord-style clients. |
| Dorian | Supported | Works when the local source tree follows the Vencord plugin structure. |


## One-Click Windows Setup

Download `DiscordLyrics-Installer.cmd`, run it, and let it install the correct build.

The installer:

- Installs the BetterDiscord plugin when BetterDiscord is detected.
- Installs the source userplugin for Vencord, Equicord, and Dorian-style clients.
- Builds the source client with `pnpm build`.
- Runs `pnpm inject` when that client exposes an inject script.

## How It Works

DiscordLyrics reads your Spotify activity from Discord, matches the current track through LRCLIB, and updates your custom status when the active lyric line changes.

Fallback format:

```text
Song - Artist
```

## Troubleshooting

If lyrics do not appear right away, check these first:

- Spotify must be connected to Discord and visible as your activity.
- The track title and artist should match the public LRCLIB listing.
- Reload Discord after enabling or updating the plugin.
- Wait a few seconds after changing songs so the lyric lookup can refresh.
- For source clients, rebuild and inject after every plugin update.
